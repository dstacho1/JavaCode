A repository for practicing and learning Java concepts 

Uploads of daily lessons found on YouTube.
Mostly from Derek Banas tutorial playlist found here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE7E8B7F4856C9B19

Also classes where I'm playing around with new ideas and getting into the habbit of programming everyday.
